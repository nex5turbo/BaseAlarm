# BaseAlarm
boiler-plate for developer who developes Android Alarm Application. Just one TimePicker, Button in MainActivity. You can Customize it for your app. When Alarm start, turn screen on and start ringtone. No snooze(DIY!!), only dismiss button.    
    
I customized this in my project "NAZ" which is Alarm Clock App for Korean University students.   
    
I wish this could help you.
